######################## INSTALLATION #############################

Before we can build this program, we have to make sure ESP-IDF knows the configuration of our esp32-a1s with the es8388 audio codec chip.

step 1:
open the pipeline_play_sdcard_music folder and run the symbolic_link_maker 2.bat

step 2:
open ESP-IDF and navigate to:

"{PATH TO GITHUB}\esp32-a1s-audio-player-exercise\Exercise 1 Music Player\pipeline_sdcard_mp3_control"

step 3:
run:
idf.py menuconfig

navigate to 'Audio HAL'
select 'custom audio board'

if symbolic_link_maker worked you should see 'Custom Audio Board' if not exit and run symbolic_link_maker.bat first

step 4:
navigate to 'Custom Audio Board'
select: 'Select a custom audio board (...'
select: 'Ai Thinker ESP32 Audio Kit (ES8388, variant 5)'
select: 'use on-board SD card'

press escape couple of times
press 'y' to apply changes

step 5:
run: idf.py build flash monitor

this can take some time...

if you don't see bunch of I2C errors in red the configuration is complete!

test the code by putting some music (.wav) on a SD card and insert it in the esp.
